Theme: Shapeshifting

bs (brainstorming):

- puzzle game
    * you fit into different shaped "holes" like in that toy for kids
    * what makes it gamey tho?

- top-down shooter type
    * you can either be small and hard to hit or big but with more firepower
    * or even more "shapes"

- sort of a "you need to get from A to B by jumping / flying" game
    * there are obstacles / paths that require you to shift your shape during the flight
    * you can maneuver up and down
    * shapeshifting has a cooldown
    * the starting shape is always the same | or maybe you can choose
    * mechanic: shift to your desired shape well before it is needed, so that you can shift into another shape much quicker (cooldown passes)
    * start with a couple of simple shapes and get more as you progress
    * each shape helps you fit through different obstacles / speeds your flight / speeds your maneuvering
